echo "📊 Management Commands:"
echo "   • View monitoring logs: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f monitoring/docker-compose.monitoring.yml logs -f"
echo "   • Check monitoring status: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f monitoring/docker-compose.monitoring.yml ps"
echo "   • Stop monitoring: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f monitoring/docker-compose.monitoring.yml down"
echo ""
echo "🔍 Verify Metrics Collection:"
echo "   • Check Prometheus targets: http://localhost:9090/targets"
echo "   • All targets should show 'UP' status"
echo "   • If any targets are 'DOWN', check service connectivity"
echo ""
echo "⚠️  Security Notes:"
echo "   • Change default Grafana password after first login"
echo "   • Consider restricting access to monitoring ports in production"
echo "   • Set up proper authentication for Grafana in production"
