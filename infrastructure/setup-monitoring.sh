echo "🔍 Verify Metrics Collection:"
echo "   • Check Prometheus targets: http://localhost:9090/targets"
echo "   • All targets should show 'UP' status"
echo "   • If any targets are 'DOWN', check service connectivity"

echo "⚠️  Security Notes:"
echo "   • Change default Grafana password after first login"
echo "   • Consider restricting access to monitoring ports in production"
echo "   • Set up proper authentication for Grafana in production"
