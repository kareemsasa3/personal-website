# ✅ SSL Setup Complete!

## 🎉 What We've Accomplished

Your portfolio project now has **complete SSL/HTTPS support** configured and ready for deployment!

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **SSL Certificate Generation**
   - ✅ Self-signed certificate created for development/testing
   - ✅ Certificate files: `infrastructure/nginx/ssl/cert.pem` and `infrastructure/nginx/ssl/key.pem`
   - ✅ Proper file permissions set (600 for key, 644 for cert)

2. **Nginx Configuration Updated**
   - ✅ HTTPS server block configured (port 443)
   - ✅ HTTP to HTTPS redirect configured (port 80)
   - ✅ SSL security settings optimized
   - ✅ HTTP/2 support enabled
   - ✅ Security headers configured (HSTS, etc.)

3. **Docker Configuration Updated**
   - ✅ SSL certificate volume mounted in both dev and prod configurations
   - ✅ Nginx container can access SSL certificates

4. **Automated Setup Scripts Created**
   - ✅ `infrastructure/ssl-setup.sh` - Comprehensive SSL setup script
   - ✅ `infrastructure/test-ssl.sh` - SSL testing script
   - ✅ `infrastructure/SSL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Complete documentation

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Development/Testing (Current Setup)
```bash
# Start services with SSL
cd infrastructure
docker-compose up --build

# Test SSL setup
./test-ssl.sh
```

### For Production
```bash
# Method 1: Automated Let's Encrypt Setup (Recommended)
cd infrastructure/prod
./lets-encrypt-setup.sh

# Method 2: Manual Setup
# 1. Generate Let's Encrypt certificate (see SSL_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
# 2. Update domain name
./ssl-setup.sh update-domain your-domain.com

# 3. Start production services
./prod.sh
```

## 🔐 Current SSL Configuration

### Certificate Details
- **Type**: Self-signed (development)
- **Domain**: localhost
- **Validity**: 365 days
- **Key Size**: 2048 bits

### Security Features
- ✅ TLS 1.2 and 1.3 only
- ✅ Strong cipher suites
- ✅ HTTP/2 support
- ✅ HSTS headers
- ✅ HTTP to HTTPS redirect
- ✅ Security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)

### Access URLs
- **Main Application**: https://localhost
- **AI Backend API**: https://localhost/api/ai/health
- **Arachne Scraper API**: https://localhost/api/scrape/health
- **Health Check**: https://localhost/health

## 🔧 Available Commands

### SSL Setup Script (`infrastructure/ssl-setup.sh`)
```bash
# Interactive setup
./ssl-setup.sh

# Generate self-signed certificate
./ssl-setup.sh self-signed your-domain.com

# Test SSL configuration
./ssl-setup.sh test

# Update domain name
./ssl-setup.sh update-domain your-domain.com
```

### SSL Test Script (`infrastructure/test-ssl.sh`)
```bash
# Test SSL with running services
./test-ssl.sh
```

## 📋 Next Steps for Production

### 1. Get a Real Domain
- Purchase a domain name
- Point it to your server's IP address

### 2. Automated Let's Encrypt Setup (Recommended)
```bash
cd infrastructure/prod
./lets-encrypt-setup.sh
```

This script will:
- ✅ Prompt for your domain and email
- ✅ Create necessary directories
- ✅ Update all configuration files
- ✅ Set up initial certificates
- ✅ Configure auto-renewal
- ✅ Test the setup

### 3. Manual Let's Encrypt Setup (Alternative)
```bash
# Install certbot
sudo apt-get install certbot

# Get certificate
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d your-domain.com

# Copy to nginx directory
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem infrastructure/nginx/ssl/cert.pem
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem infrastructure/nginx/ssl/key.pem

# Set permissions
sudo chmod 600 infrastructure/nginx/ssl/key.pem
sudo chmod 644 infrastructure/nginx/ssl/cert.pem
```

### 4. Update Domain Configuration
```bash
./ssl-setup.sh update-domain your-domain.com
```

### 5. Set Up Auto-Renewal
```bash
# Automated setup creates renew-ssl.sh
# Add to crontab:
crontab -e
# Add: 0 12 * * * /path/to/your/project/renew-ssl.sh
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Browser Security Warning (Self-Signed)**
- This is normal for self-signed certificates
- Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)"

**Certificate Not Found**
```bash
ls -la infrastructure/nginx/ssl/
```

**Permission Denied**
```bash
chmod 600 infrastructure/nginx/ssl/key.pem
chmod 644 infrastructure/nginx/ssl/cert.pem
```

**Services Not Starting**
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs nginx

# Test configuration
./ssl-setup.sh test
```
